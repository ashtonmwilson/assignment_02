# Assignment 2

## Ashton Wilson
***
<p>I decided to take this class because it is required for my
<br />Major. I am also interested in learning html and CSS. I took this class for a third time, because I thought I would be better about procrastination, and time dedication. I am not.
</p>
<br />
### I hope to learn:
<ol>
  <li>How to make a beautifully initeractive website.</li>
  <li>To take a photoshop mockup, and write code to bring it to life.</li>
  <li>Fluency in these coding languages, that enables me to learn python, and other widely used languages.</li>
  </ol>
